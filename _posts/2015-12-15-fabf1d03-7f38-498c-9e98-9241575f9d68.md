# About the Author:

In his writing, Geoffrey K. Liu is a bitter, cynical romantic: If there's going to be a happy ending, someone better die for it. Or at least suffer pretty horrendously. Geoff has had work published in various fine publications, which you can check out [here][0]. Otherwise, you can't find him on social media, and he stays pretty quiet for the most part, but you can contact him at geoffkl77@comcast.net. Oh, and by the way, **\#Bernie2016**.
