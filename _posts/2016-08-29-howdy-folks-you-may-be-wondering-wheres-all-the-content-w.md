  Howdy folks! You may be wondering where’s all the content? What’s ol’ Geoffrey
  K. Liu—writer, author, all around whatever—up to? Well, you can still find
  some of the stuff I’ve published on Amazon and such, and it’s certainly an

Howdy folks! You may be wondering where's all the content? What's ol' Geoffrey K. Liu---writer, author, all around whatever---up to? Well, you can still find some of the stuff I've published on Amazon and such, and it's certainly an interesting pile.

But one must admit when the show is over. For me, the writing show was over long ago. Truth be told, it wasn't much of a show to begin with. I have mostly come through the battle with depression unscathed, but I've sacrificed my writing. 

I'm not made to do it. Not a lot of writers---or former writers---can probably admit that. I, on the other hand, have no problem with that:

I am not a writer. Not now, not ever. Sure, I've written some good stuff---even cockroaches produce babies, but they don't call themselves parents. I mean, of course they don't, they're cockroaches. But you know what I mean.

I'm not doing nothing, though, so all zero of you who might read this, head on over to gklwoodworks.com.
