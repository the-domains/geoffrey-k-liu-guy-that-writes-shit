The Message

****

Jenny Wade turned quite pale when the man showed up on the doorstep of her little beach cottage. She was seventy-five years old, widowed, and no longer blessed with a wealth of visitors, aside from her dear friend Marie, another old widow she met in town for coffee every Sunday. 

The man was young, grim, familiar. He smelled of the sea, which might not have been unusual given many things in the little coastal town smelled of the sea. His scent, however, was strong and deep, like driftwood recently washed ashore.

"Miss Porter?" the man said when she opened her door. The name sent a shiver through her.

"I'm sorry, my name isn't Porter, it's Wade."

He frowned as if he didn't believe her. "It was Porter once, long ago."

"Well ... yes. Before I was married. How did you know?"

"May I come in, Miss Porter? I'm a fisherman, and I found something that belongs to you. Something from when you were still Miss Jenny Porter."

The way he looked at her then both frightened her and set her heart aflutter, a sensation she had not felt for more years than she dared count. His gaze was naked and unyielding, his green eyes faded and hard like so many of the fishermen she saw in town, the ones who disappeared for weeks at a time, but drank hard and got loud when they came back. They scared her a little, but also reminded her of a simpler time. The world was constantly changing, but these men never did. 

He was carrying a green bottle with a cork stuck in the end of it. At first she thought he might be drunk, but then she saw that the bottle was very old, filthy on the outside, and empty except for what appeared to be a rolled up piece of paper. She could not deny that she was intrigued.

"I'm sorry, sir, but I'm an old woman as you can see, and allowing a stranger---"

"I understand, Miss Porter."

"Could you _please _stop calling me that?"

"It's your name, is it not?"

"My name is Wade," she said. "My _husband's _name was Wade."

He grimaced slightly at this as if he had tasted something bitter. "Miss ... _Wade_, then. I found this bottle at sea and it contains a message for you. It's how I found you and how I know your name. I'll be happy leave you alone, it's just that I've walked a long way to bring this, and was wondering if I could at least trouble you for a glass of water."

Jenny's heart sank. Hospitality wasn't what it used to be in this day and age, and here she was, in her quiet little hometown, turning away a young man simply because he gave her the heebie-jeebies. She decided that it was only the surprise of his presence, and not the man himself, that did so.

"I'm sorry, please come in. I'm not used to visitors, and an old woman must be careful."

"Of course, Miss Porter."

Jenny ushered the young man through the front door; his scent grew cloying as he passed. If he was a fisherman like he said, he had only recently stepped off the boat. His heavy shore boots clomped across the wood floor of her little cottage and into the living room. He stood there, suddenly seeming far too big for the small space, and gazed at her.

"Please, sit," she said. "I'll fetch you a glass of water."

"Thank you, Miss P---Miss Wade."

Jenny slipped into the kitchen, took a glass from the cabinet, and went to the sink. "You say you're a fisherman," she said to alleviate the silence. "Which boat are you on?"

"The Lady Eliza."

The glass smashed at the bottom of the porcelain sink. Jenny looked down at her trembling hands. She could feel her heart pounding and she thought, T_his can't be healthy for a ticker as old as mine_. She turned and made her way back to the living room, where the man stood, bottle in hand, green eyes on her. It seemed to her that he hadn't blinked those eyes once since he had shown up on her doorstep.

"You---you said the Lady Eliza?" Jenny asked.

"Yes."

"The Lady Eliza vanished forty years ago. Along with her skipper."

He looked at her with those unblinking green eyes and said nothing. Jenny's heart was thundering and she felt light-headed. "I think you ought to go now, sir."

There was a loud, melodic _fump_! that made her jump and squeal softly before she realized it was only the cork pulling from the neck of the bottle. The man tossed it carelessly aside, then turned over the bottle and began tapping the neck against his palm rhythmically, a low, hollow tone sounding with every tap that seemed to match her heart in tempo. His unblinking, sea-green eyes never left her.

After a moment, the contents of the bottle slipped into the man's hand. He unrolled the paper, which contained a smaller square of paper. He held out the larger one to her, and her trembling hand reached out and took it. It curled again from its years inside the bottle, and as she tried to unroll it, she dropped it. She felt old and exhausted, and could only stare down at the letter. She could see that water had pooled around the man's feet. The scent of seawater had grown stronger.

"To my dearest Jenny," the man said, reciting the letter from memory, "it is in good health and love that I hope this letter finds you, if it ever does."

"Don't---"

"When last we saw each other," he continued, staring at her, his voice insistent, "I learned that your heart belonged to another. My own heart is broken. It was my intention to commit myself to you forever. I now commit myself to the sea, the only place I belong if I don't belong to you." His voice softened a bit as he came to the last lines. "My love ... is _yours _forever. One day, perhaps, I shall return to you."

Jenny felt a shock of pain travel through her back, then her jaw. She felt as if she might be sick at any moment. 

The man concluded the letter, "With my eternal love, Thomas." Then he held up the other piece of paper. It was a worn black and white photograph of the man who stood before her now. In his arms was a young woman, smiling and beautiful. A young woman Jenny only vaguely recognized now. The two of them were standing on a dock before a fishing boat with the words 'Lady Eliza' painted on its bow.

"Tommy," she said, but her voice was only a weak whisper against the shortness of breath that had afflicted her.

"I'm only a fisherman," he said. "When I came back to port to find you in the arms of your handsome doctor, I knew I could never be enough. I knew I had lost you. So I sent this letter out to sea. And myself with it."

"I loved you, Tommy," Jenny managed to say, "but you were always gone for so long. My heart broke when I heard you had...." She could no longer continue. Her teeth gritted against the pain in her chest, her hand clutched at it.

"You belong to me," Tommy said. "You always have." He stepped forward and wrapped his arms around her, his strong fisherman's arms. She was engulfed by his overpowering sea smell, but she didn't hate it. Quite the opposite.

_Good_, she thought, _I'm ready_. Her life with John Wade, the one she had chosen over an absentee fisherman, had been good, sometimes wonderful. But somehow she had always known it would end this way, with him. Her Tommy, who had given himself away to the sea, only to return when it was time for his lost love to come home. He had been her first love, and would be her last.

She felt water soaking into her clothes, her skin. She tasted seawater first in her mouth, and then it filled her throat, then her lungs. She tried to cough it out, but couldn't. For only a moment, the pain was tremendous.

****

Jenny Wade---or Jenny Porter as she had been known to a young, lovestruck fisherman long ago---died on the floor of her little cottage, clutching the photograph and the letter of love that had made their way to her across the vast and depthless sea.
