**The Tasting**

_a flash fiction story, (c)2015, Geoffrey K. Liu_

_Bruxism. Migraine. Period. Fight._

The words marched through Annie's mind along with each throb of her sickening headache, reminders of her current misery. The bruxism, the fancy-sounding medical condition of chronic teeth-grinding, had brought on the migraine in the car. Her period had come a week early, a little gift from God. Then had come the fight with Karl over why she had been so grumpy and how her mood was souring this trip.

"...when the grappa gets nice and form and yuicy, then we...." The winery tour guide's voice floated in and out of her foggy mind just long enough for her to think his accent was a put on. His thick, hairy knuckles were wrapped around one of the big grapes hanging from the vine, cradling it lovingly. Annie thought, _Form and yuicy? And Grappa isn't a word for grape; it's the brand name of an Italian brandy. _

It hardly seemed important, even as the tour guide droned on in his obviously fake accent--obvious to her, anyway. The rest of their group was utterly charmed by him. 

_Grappa. Form and yuicy. Bruxism. Migraine. Period. Fight._

As the group began working its way through the rows of grapevines again, Annie felt a hand on her arm. It was Karl.

"Honey, you okay?"

"No, Karl, I told you I'm not okay."

"You look awful."

"Thank you so much."

"No, I mean--" Karl sputtered. "I'm sorry about before. I know you don't feel good, and I shouldn't have dragged you here."

"I'm sorry too, you've been looking forward to this," Annie said. "I know this place makes your favorite wine."

"Our favorite wine," Karl corrected.

"Yes, ours. But I feel like if I touch a drop, I'm going to barf." Annie dropped her voice to a conspiratorial level. "And am I the only one who noticed this guy's accent is total bullshit?"

Karl looked perplexed and glanced at their guide. "I hadn't noticed."

"Whatever. Can we go?"

Karl gave her a patronizing but relenting look. "Okay. Let's go back to the hotel."

"Do it quietly, so Mr. Grappa doesn't notice."

"What?"

"Forget it."

The two of them snuck away from the tour group, then over to the next row of grapevines. There was a clear path back to the visitor's center, and Annie could see a gathering of a dozen or so people on the granite patio there, highlighted by the flickering flames of a large fire in a fire pit and the orange-red hues of evening sunlight.

"Lovely," Annie said, "now we have to sneak back through a party."

"Quit being so paranoid, no one cares if we leave."

"But look, they're all dressed up, it's some kind of formal thing."

Karl sighed. "Just come on, Ann."

He pulled her along the row of grapevines. As they approached the visitor's center, her eyes rested on the people there, all of them dressed in their finest evening wear, the men in tuxedos, the women in gowns. What was this? 

As they drew closer, all eyes turned and looked at them.

_Bruxism. Migraine. Period. Fight. Scrutiny. _The words, and her head, throbbed even harder.

A man broke off the group and walked to the edge of the patio. His grin beneath a neat pencil mustache was almost a rictus. His black hair was combed into an oily slick. It has to be Brylcreem, Annie thought. Do they still make Brylcreem?

"Welcome, friends," the man said.

"We were just leaving," Karl said, a thick waver in his voice.

The man cocked his head quizzically to one side. "You're not here for the tasting?"

"No. My--my wife is ill. We'll have to come back tomorrow evening."

The man stared at them--everyone stared at them--and his grin faltered a bit. His terrible grin. His black eyes slipped behind them for a moment. Annie glanced back and saw that their tour group, including Mr. Grappa, had followed them up here and was standing as silently as the others.

"We're sorry to interrupt your party," Annie said, "but may we get by?" Her eyes settled on the double doors leading through the visitor's center, to the parking lot beyond, and away from this awkwardness.

Mr. Brylcreem stepped aside to let them pass. She and Karl stepped onto the patio, but after a moment, she felt Brylcreem's grip on her shoulder. She barely noticed Karl's hand slipping from her own. She turned into Brylcreem's piercing black gaze.

"This tasting is for you," he said.

He gestured slightly with his head, and Annie saw a large cart being wheeled out by two men in chef's jackets. Her breath hitched violently. The cart held the most exquisite ice sculpture she had ever seen. The detail was perfect, the nude female figure carved in smooth, crystal-clear ice, standing daintily on its toes, arms down, palms turned forward, head turned to one side. The tranquil face was familiar and unmistakable. It was her face. It was Annie's face.

The men stopped the cart in the middle of the patio as the group around her gasped in appreciation of the sculpture.

"Oh god," Annie whispered. "Karl?"

She glanced around in a panic. Karl was gone and she felt her last defense crumble.

One of the men in white picked up a crystal decanter filled with translucent pink liquid. He held it up to the back of the sculpture's head and poured. The liquid drifted down, highlighting the exceptionally detailed system of veins inside the thing.

"It's--it's me? How?" Annie said, and Mr. Brylcreem only smiled wider.

The pink liquid filled the sculpture's veins from head to toe. To Annie's horror, some of the liquid dripped from between the sculpture's legs, running in rivulets down the inner thighs into a crystal bowl at the sculpture's feet.

"What is this?" Annie asked. "Where's my husband?"

Brylcreem's grip tightened on her shoulder, and he said, "Let the tasting begin."

The congregation closed in.
